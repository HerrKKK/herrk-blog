                            Finally I have built a quite useful framework of a web page.</br>
                            I will learn javascript to make it able to interact with my back-end in next few days.</br>
                            Then I will come back to Java and focus on the Back-end.</br>
                            Further more, I would make a plan for next study steps this weekend.</br>

                            Today I added the adaptive layout to the page.</br>
                            I have substantively grasped the basic method of using js.</br>
                            And I found it indispensible to master MySQL to propel the work further.</br>
                            I would do that as well as the study plan mentioned yesterday</br>

                            Today I added a simple but avilible and secure sign in and up system.</br>
                            encrypt user's password with MD5 and then encrypt it again after adding salt to it</br>
                            The salt was generated by secure java method and different for each person</br>
                            I would study SQL further and make plans tommorow</br>

                            It has been one month since I updated this log last time, however, I did consecutively</br>
                            contribute to this website in the mouth and I will try to summarise the changes below:
                            1. Improve the flawed auto-login system to avoid the situation when the local token was</br>
                            destroyed by the browser but the HTTP session was not.
                            2. Add a minimum but available article system with a minimum editor page attached, now</br>
                            we can submit an article with title, main body to the server and the server would save</br>
                            the title, the author and some other info of the article but the function of display</br>
                            and saving the main body article has not been implemented yet</br>
                            3. Today we added a minimum weather panel to the front end but it need a further optimize</br></br>

                            Goals:
                            1. Now we MUST switch the whole project to Spring structure from the original servlet one</br>
                            2. Try to master database(MYSQL) and make it a core at the current phase.</br>
                            3. Try to master the details of the java language.</br>
